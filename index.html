    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Jorge. I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer who loves math, coding, solving technical problems, learning and sharing my knowledge with others.</p>
    </br></br>
    <p>I'm originally from Caracas, Venezuela but I've been based in Salt Lake City, Utah since 2017. I speak Spanish and English. My favorite programming language is, as of now, JavaScript.</p>
    </br></br>
    <p>I consider myself a very detail-oriented person and I'm always aiming for excellence and success. I also like creating things from scratch â€” just like this website!</p>
